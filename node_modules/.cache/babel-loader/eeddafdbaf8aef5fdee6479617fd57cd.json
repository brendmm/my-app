During my time in school, I have taken courses in data structures and applied software design, as well as control systems and embedded software design. I also have experience in the coding of microcontrollers. At the same time, I have experience in industry interning with companies such as Optum where I have been able to further my skill set. Here I have learned NoSQL database design in the form of graphing databases as well as frontend web design using ReactJS. Through the combination of these experiences I have been able to obtain, I am excited to pursue a career in this field. Beyond my technical skills, I have many personal qualities that help me perform in a professional environment. Two words that describe me are communicative and determined. In conversations, I always want to make sure everyone is heard and given a chance to provide input. The more opinions we have the better the product will be. My determination leads me to want to get my work done fast and not let obstacles stand in my way. In an agile environment I make sure my user stories are completed and can then go help teammates. I believe the combination of these personality traits make me a great fit for this company. I will deeply appreciate any consideration you offer my application.
